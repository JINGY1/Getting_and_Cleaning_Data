# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data

# Objective:
1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# File description:
1 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
2 'features.txt': List of all features.
3 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name. (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
4 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
5 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
6 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
7 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
8 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
9 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
10 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
11 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
